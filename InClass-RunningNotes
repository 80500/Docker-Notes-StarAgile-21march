=============================



We can access the application runnign on the container in 2 ways:

1. Docker exec command 

2. via the browser

Port Mapping

It is done with docker run command 
If for a container we ahve not done port mapping.. then you cannot access it .. you cannot do port mapping after the container has been created

It is waste.. delete the container and create again

Port mapping is represented by -p or -P



Demo: Convert a container into a Custom Image 
============================================================
Step 1: We will create an Ubuntu(OS) container 

Step 2: We will go inside the container (-it)

Step 3: We will install some package on the container 

step 4: come out of container 

step 5: Commit a container to an Image ==> our own image 

docker commit containername imagename 

Step 6: Push the image to docker Hub -> our own registry 

docker push myimage01

docker push sonal04/myimage01
 
Step 7: From Docker Host login to docker hub

Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker Hub

Step 8: Change Image name so that we can push it into our own docker hub repository 

docker tag olsImagename dockerhubaccount/imagename

docker tag myimage01 sonal04/myimage01

Step 9: Push the image to docker Hub -> our own registry 

docker push sonal04/myimage01


DockerFile 
=====================
Dockerfile is a simple text file 
It is a manifest file of docker tool only
This file when built, you will get a custom Image 

The name of this file is going to be Dockerfile or dockerfile 

No programing language and no scripting language 

syntax: 

keyword command/argument
========================================

FROM : what will be the Base image over which we will do customization 
This is always the first line of dockerfile 
This is mandatory and is not repeated 

RUN : with this keyword we can pass any linux commands to install/upgrade any packages on the container 
that has to be pre-executed on the container .
RUN keyword can be repeated multiple times

COPY : copy a file from host machine to container directory 

ADD : copy a file from host machine to container directory 
Copy file from remote server to container directory 
If we have to copy tar files on the container we will use ADD keyword 

EXPOSE : we will give port number to which container will be exposed 

CMD : When the container is launched if we want a command to conitnue to run on the container then we use this keyword

EntryPOINT: When the container is launched if we want a command to conitnue to run on the container then we use this keyword
